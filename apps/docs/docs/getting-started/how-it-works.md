# How It Works

Learn about the mechanics behind $LUKAS.

## Basket Mechanism

$LUKAS maintains its value through a weighted basket of Latin American currencies:

1. **Price Oracle**: Real-time currency rates from trusted sources
2. **Rebalancing**: Automatic adjustments to maintain target weights
3. **Collateralization**: Backed by reserves in constituent currencies

## Smart Contract Architecture

The $LUKAS ecosystem consists of several smart contracts:

- **Token Contract**: ERC-20 compatible token
- **Oracle Contract**: Price feed aggregation
- **Reserve Contract**: Collateral management
- **Governance Contract**: Community decision-making

## Minting & Burning

### Minting
Users can mint $LUKAS by depositing the appropriate basket of currencies.

### Burning
$LUKAS can be burned to redeem the underlying currency basket.
