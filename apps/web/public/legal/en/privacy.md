If you do not agree with this Policy, do not use the Web App.

## 1. Scope

This Policy applies to information processed by the Service Providers through the Web App. It does not apply to third-party services (wallet providers, block explorers, RPC providers) which have their own privacy practices.

## 2. Information we collect

### 2.1 Information you provide

Depending on how you use the Web App, you may provide:

- support requests and communications (e.g., emails, messages),
- any information you include in forms or feedback.

### 2.2 Information collected automatically

We may collect certain technical information automatically:

- device and browser information (e.g., user agent, OS, language),
- approximate location inferred from IP address,
- pages viewed and interactions,
- referring/exit pages, timestamps.

### 2.3 Wallet addresses and on-chain data

The Web App may display and interact with **public blockchain addresses** and transaction data.

- Wallet addresses and transactions are typically **public** on-chain.
- We do not control public blockchains and cannot delete or modify on-chain data.

## 3. Cookies and similar technologies

We may use cookies or similar technologies to:

- remember preferences (e.g., language),
- maintain basic functionality,
- understand usage and improve performance.

You can control cookies through your browser settings.

## 4. How we use information

We may use information to:

- provide and operate the Web App,
- monitor performance and troubleshoot issues,
- prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents,
- comply with legal obligations,
- communicate with you (e.g., support).

## 5. Legal bases (where applicable)

Depending on your jurisdiction, we process information based on:

- performance of a contract (providing the Web App),
- legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, product improvement),
- consent (where required),
- legal obligations.

## 6. Sharing and disclosure

We may share information:

- with service providers (hosting, analytics, security) who process it on our behalf,
- with professional advisors (legal, accounting) as necessary,
- to comply with law, lawful requests, or to protect rights, safety, and security,
- in connection with a corporate transaction (merger, acquisition, restructuring).

We do not sell personal information.

## 7. Data retention

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Web App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

## 8. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 9. International transfers

Your information may be processed in countries other than your country of residence. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards.

## 10. Your rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:

- access, correct, or delete certain information,
- object to or restrict processing,
- data portability,
- withdraw consent.

Because blockchain data is public and decentralized, deletion of on-chain data may not be possible.

## 11. Children's privacy

The Web App is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 12. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date will change. Continued use of the Web App after updates constitutes acceptance.
