LUKAS MANIFESTO
================

1. Money should serve people, not borders.
   Latin America is one region, one economic story, and millions of lives in motion.
   Our currencies were never designed for this reality. LUKAS is.

2. LUKAS is a LatAm basket, not a single flag.
   1 LUKA tracks the blended strength of BRL, MXN, COP, CLP, and ARS.
   No single government, bank, or crisis should define the future of everyone else.

3. Stability is a public good, not a luxury product.
   Stable money is the foundation for saving, building, and planning.
   It must be programmable, transparent, and available to anyone with a phone.

4. The peg lives in code, not in promises.
   LUKAS is stabilized by open-source algorithms:
   - On-chain FX prices
   - Public index math
   - Uniswap v4 hooks that defend the peg
   If the code changes, the world can see it. If the peg moves, the math explains why.

5. Liquidity is our central bank.
   Instead of closed balance sheets, we use open liquidity:
   - AMMs as real-time FX engines
   - On-chain vaults as reserves
   - Arbitrage, not decree, to keep prices honest.

6. Memes are our language, not our excuse.
   We embrace the meme to spread the idea, not to hide from responsibility.
   LUKAS is fun on the surface and rigorous underneath:
   - Serious collateral
   - Serious risk controls
   - Serious respect for users’ savings.

7. LatAm is not an afterthought market.
   We refuse the narrative that Latin America must wait for global finance to notice it.
   We build first for Bogotá, São Paulo, Mexico City, Santiago, Buenos Aires — and beyond.

8. Open source or it doesn’t count.
   - The index is open.
   - The hooks are open.
   - The vault logic is open.
   Anyone can inspect, fork, improve, or challenge our design.

9. Users are not exit liquidity.
   The goal is not speculation; the goal is usable, dependable money.
   - For merchants who accept small payments every day.
   - For workers who cross borders physically and financially.
   - For communities that deserve better tools than inflation and capital controls.

10. We are early, not alone.
    LUKAS stands on the shoulders of many:
    - Local stablecoins across LatAm
    - Builders of DeFi primitives
    - Researchers of FX, risk, and governance
    Our role is to connect these pieces into one regional monetary layer.

Commitment
----------
We will:
- Ship in the open.
- Favor simplicity over fragility.
- Treat users’ trust as the scarcest asset we have.
- Iterate with caution where it touches people’s savings, and with courage where it expands their options.

This text is not a legal contract, but a public commitment:
a reference point the community can use to hold us accountable.
